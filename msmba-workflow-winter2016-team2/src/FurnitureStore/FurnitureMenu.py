'''
The Order Taker User Interface for the coffee bar workflow (Winter Intensives Lab 5)

This is where you define the fields that appear on the screen (application) the order
taker sees and tell WMP how this application (user interface) fits into the overall
workflow.

Note:  the comments here assume you have already read through the comments
in CoffeeBackend.py and made your edits there.
