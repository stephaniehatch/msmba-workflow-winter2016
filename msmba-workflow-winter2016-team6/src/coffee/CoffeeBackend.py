    The CoffeeBackend "class" is a collection of the "methods" (functions) that do the actual
    wiring together of the steps in the coffee bar process.
    
    A back end will always include the methods __init__ and wire and will also include a method
    to handle each event that occurs in the process.  For Lab 5 we have set up the two additional
    methods you need:  drink_order_taken and drink_prepared.
    
    See instruction documentation to see what you need to do.

    def __init__(self):

    def wire(self):
        '''
        The wire method is where we tell MWP which tasks to keep track of.
        To register a task, you will need to add a line of code that looks
        like this:
        self.register_result_listener("RoleName", "TaskName", self.method_name)
        Where: RoleName is the person who did the task
               TaskName is the name of the task they did
               self.method_name refers to a method in this class which should respond to
                                the task being completed.
        '''
        # !!! add a line of code here to register the step where a drink order is taken.
        # !!! add a line of code here to register the step where a drink is prepared.

    def drink_order_taken(self, results):
        '''
        This method (i.e. function) gets called to update data and schedule any tasks
        necessary after a drink order is taken.  Specifically, this function
        will set the status to "complete" on the "take drink order" task
        and assigns the preparation of this drink to the Barista.
        '''
        for result in results:  # repeat the following actions for each result
            # !!! Fix the line below...
            task = 'you need to replace this text in quotes with the right code ' 
            self.workflow.add(task) # add the new task to the workflow
            self.workflow.update_status(result, Status.COMPLETE)

    def drink_prepared(self, results):
        '''
        This method is called after the barista has prepared the drink.  
        In our very simple workflow this is the last step in the process, 
        which means that this method has a very simple job:  it just needs to mark 
        the status of the barista's task (stored in the results variable) as Complete.  
        '''
        #!!! Replace this pass, with appropriate code (using the drink_order_taken) method
        #as insipiration...
        pass

'''
Finally, this last bit of code is fine as it is and you do not need to change it.
It initialize the backend by running the __init__ method
of the CoffeeBackend class (above), among other things.
